# `envelope` - Attachments

Attachments are defined in [BCR-2023-006](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-006-envelope-attachment.md). They are a standardized way to add discoverable third-party data to an envelope.

Attachments are assertions that can be built up by using various invocations of the `envelope` command line tool, but since they have a specific format, the `envelope` tool provides shortcuts for creating and working with them.

## Attachment Subcommands

```

## Creating an Attachment

The `attachment create` command lets you create an attachment by specifying its fields: `vendor`, `conforms-to` (optional), and `payload`.

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
envelope attachment create --help
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
OVERVIEW: Create an attachment.

USAGE: envelope attachment create <vendor> [--conforms-to <conforms-to>] [<payload>]

ARGUMENTS:
  <vendor>                The vendor that adds this attachment. Usually a reverse domain name.
  <payload>               The payload of the attachment. Entirely specified by the vendor.

OPTIONS:
  --conforms-to <conforms-to>
                          The spec to which this attachment conforms. Usually a URI.
  --version               Show the version.
  -h, --help              Show help information.
```

But first we need an envelope that is our attachment "payload", i.e., the vendor-specific data that we want to attach to an envelope. This can any possible envelope of arbitrary complexity, but here we'll just use a simple string:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
PAYLOAD_ENVELOPE=`envelope subject "this-is-the-payload"`
```

Now we create our attachment with our payload, and specify the vendor and conformance strings:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
VENDOR="com.example"
CONFORMS_TO="https://example.com/attachment"
ATTACHMENT=`envelope attachment create $VENDOR --conforms-to $CONFORMS_TO $PAYLOAD_ENVELOPE`
```

Here's what our attachment looks like in envelope notation:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
envelope $ATTACHMENT
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
'attachment': {
    "this-is-the-payload"
} [
    'conformsTo': "https://example.com/attachment"
    'vendor': "com.example"
]
```

Notice that attachments are "bare assertions," i.e., assertions without a subject. Recall that assertions have a predicate and an object: in this case the predicate is the known value `'attachment'` and the object is the payload, which is wrapped and then has its own `'vendor'` and `'conformsTo'` assertions added to it.

## Querying an Attachment

Now that we have an attachment, we can query it for its vendor:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
envelope attachment vendor $ATTACHMENT
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
com.example
```

Or for its conformance:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
envelope attachment conforms-to $ATTACHMENT
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
https://example.com/attachment
```

Or for its payload:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
envelope attachment payload $ATTACHMENT
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
ur:envelope/tpcsjkjyisinjkdpinjkdpjyisihdpjohskkjzjlhsiefgjtesdk
```

Note that since the payload is itself an envelope which can be arbitrarily complex, it is returned as a UR. So we can take the result of the above command and extract its subject as a string:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
envelope extract `envelope attachment payload $ATTACHMENT`
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
this-is-the-payload
```

## Adding an Attachment

Now that we have an attachment, let's create a simple envelope to add it to:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
ENVELOPE=`envelope subject "this-is-the-envelope"`
```

Since we already have an attachment, we can add it to our envelope using the `attachment add envelope` command:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
ENVELOPE_WITH_ATTACHMENT=`envelope attachment add envelope $ATTACHMENT $ENVELOPE`

envelope $ENVELOPE_WITH_ATTACHMENT
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
"this-is-the-envelope" [
    'attachment': {
        "this-is-the-payload"
    } [
        'conformsTo': "https://example.com/attachment"
        'vendor': "com.example"
    ]
]
```

## Multiple Attachments

Let's say the vendor releases a new version of the attachment spec. But for backwards compatibility, they want to support both the old and the new version. So they create a new attachment with the new version, and add it to the envelope. we start by creating the version 2 payload:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
PAYLOAD_ENVELOPE_V2=`envelope subject "this-is-the-payload-v2"`
```

In the previous example we created the attachment and then added it to the envelope, but we can also do it in one step by using the `attachment add components` command:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
ENVELOPE_WITH_TWO_ATTACHMENTS=`envelope attachment add components "com.example" --conforms-to "https://example.com/attachment-v2" $PAYLOAD_ENVELOPE_V2 $ENVELOPE_WITH_ATTACHMENT`

envelope $ENVELOPE_WITH_TWO_ATTACHMENTS
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
"this-is-the-envelope" [
    'attachment': {
        "this-is-the-payload"
    } [
        'conformsTo': "https://example.com/attachment"
        'vendor': "com.example"
    ]
    'attachment': {
        "this-is-the-payload-v2"
    } [
        'conformsTo': "https://example.com/attachment-v2"
        'vendor': "com.example"
    ]
]
```

## Enumerating Attachments

The `count`, `all`, and `at` commands let you enumerate the attachments in an envelope:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
envelope attachment count $ENVELOPE_WITH_TWO_ATTACHMENTS
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
2
```

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
envelope attachment all $ENVELOPE_WITH_TWO_ATTACHMENTS
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
ur:envelope/oycseylstpsptpcsjkjyisinjkdpinjkdpjyisihdpjohskkjzjlhsieoycseetpcsksckisjyjyjojkftdldlihkshsjnjojzihdmiajljndlhsjyjyhsiaisjnihjtjyoycseotpcsjeiajljndmihkshsjnjojzihzozmhhao

```

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
envelope attachment at 0 $ENVELOPE_WITH_TWO_ATTACHMENTS
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
ur:envelope/oycseylstpsptpcsjkjyisinjkdpinjkdpjyisihdpjohskkjzjlhsieoycseetpcsksckisjyjyjojkftdldlihkshsjnjojzihdmiajljndlhsjyjyhsiaisjnihjtjyoycseotpcsjeiajljndmihkshsjnjojzihzozmhhao
```

## Finding Attachments

The `find` command lets you find attachments that match a given set of attributes. In these examples we pipe the results to `wc -l` to count the number of attachments that match the given attributes.

There are two attachments in our envelope, and both were added by the same vendor, so we can find them both by specifying the vendor:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
envelope attachment find --vendor "com.example" $ENVELOPE_WITH_TWO_ATTACHMENTS | wc -l
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
2
```

Each of these two attachments have different conformance URIs, so we can just find the version 2 attachment by specifying its conformance URI:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
envelope attachment find --conforms-to "https://example.com/attachment-v2" $ENVELOPE_WITH_TWO_ATTACHMENTS | wc -l
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
1
```
