# envelope - Verifiable Credential Example

In this example we build a permanent resident card, which the holder then redacts to reveal only selected information necessary to prove his identity.

Envelopes can also be built to support verifiable credentials, supporting the core functionality of DIDs.

John Smith's identifier:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
JOHN_CID=`envelope generate cid --hex 78bc30004776a3905bccb9b8a032cf722ceaf0bbfb1a49eaf3185fab5808cadc`
```

A photo of John Smith:

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
JOHN_IMAGE=`envelope subject "John Smith Smiling" | \
envelope assertion --known-predicate note "This is an image of John Smith." | \
envelope assertion --known-predicate dereferenceVia --uri https://exampleledger.com/digest/36be30726befb65ca13b136ae29d8081f64792c2702415eb60ad1c56ed33c999`
```

```

John wishes to identify himself to a third party using his government-issued credential, but does not wish to reveal more than his name, his photo, and the fact that the state has verified his identity.

Redaction is performed by building a set of digests that will be revealed. All digests not present in the reveal-set will be replaced with elision markers containing only the hash of what has been elided, thus preserving the hash tree including revealed signatures. If a higher-level object is elided, then everything it contains will also be elided, so if a deeper object is to be revealed, all of its parent objects also need to be revealed, even though not everything *about* the parent objects must be revealed.

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
# Start a target set.
TARGET=()

# Reveal the card. Without this, everything about the card would be elided.
TARGET+=(`envelope digest $JOHN_RESIDENT_CARD`)

# Reveal everything about the state's signature on the card
TARGET+=(`envelope assertion find --known-predicate verifiedBy $JOHN_RESIDENT_CARD | envelope digest --deep`)

# Reveal the top level of the card.
TARGET+=(`envelope digest $JOHN_RESIDENT_CARD --shallow`)
CARD=`envelope extract --wrapped $JOHN_RESIDENT_CARD`
TARGET+=(`envelope digest $CARD`)
TARGET+=(`envelope extract $CARD --envelope | envelope digest`)

# Reveal everything about the `isA` and `issuer` assertions at the top level of the card.
TARGET+=(`envelope assertion find --known-predicate isA $CARD | envelope digest --deep`)
TARGET+=(`envelope assertion find --known-predicate issuer $CARD | envelope digest --deep`)

# Reveal the `holder` assertion on the card, but not any of its sub-assertions.
HOLDER=`envelope assertion find --known-predicate holder $CARD`
TARGET+=(`envelope digest --shallow $HOLDER`)

# Within the `holder` assertion, reveal everything about just the `givenName`, `familyName`, and `image` assertions.
HOLDER_OBJECT=`envelope extract --object $HOLDER`
TARGET+=(`envelope assertion find givenName $HOLDER_OBJECT | envelope digest --deep`)
TARGET+=(`envelope assertion find familyName $HOLDER_OBJECT | envelope digest --deep`)
TARGET+=(`envelope assertion find image $HOLDER_OBJECT | envelope digest --deep`)

Print the number of digests in the target set.

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
echo ${#TARGET[@]}
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
46
```

Remove duplicates to get the number of unique digests in the target. Duplicates don't harm anything, but they might point to opportunities for optimization.

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
UNIQUE_DIGESTS=( `for i in ${TARGET[@]}; do echo $i; done | sort -u` )
echo ${#UNIQUE_DIGESTS[@]}
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
40
```

Note that the original card and the elided card have the same digest.

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
envelope digest $JOHN_RESIDENT_CARD; envelope digest $ELIDED_CARD
```

```
ðŸ‘ˆ
ur:crypto-digest/hdcxkilbmyntethdcpmntddrwfnnbdnbhynbqdbdgwnlylaoonmoleoyztfsnbasdyclmkpeoxgr
ur:crypto-digest/hdcxkilbmyntethdcpmntddrwfnnbdnbhynbqdbdgwnlylaoonmoleoyztfsnbasdyclmkpeoxgr
```

Note that the state's signature on the elided card still verifies.

```bash
ðŸ‘‰
envelope verify --silent $ELIDED_CARD --pubkeys $STATE_PUBKEYS
```
